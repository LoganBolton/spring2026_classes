a) What is Data Mining ?

Datamining is the process of using statistics and machine learning to unconver non obvious patterns and trends across large datasets. 


b) Explain knowledge discovery steps in a Framework like Web Mining?

Web mining requires you to clean and aggregate the data in a warehouse. Then, the data cube is constructed and the specific data is selected for mining. Finally afte mining, the results are presented.

c) Write the Data Preprocessing, Data Mining and Data Post Processing inclusive
processes in a knowledge discovery process from Machine Learning and Statistics
approach?

Data preprocessing involves normalization, feature selection and dimension selection. 
Data mining involves using methods like clustering and classification on the selceted data. 
Finally, data post processing involves visualizing and inteprerting the patterns that have been discovered.

# 2
Write 5 data mining functions and give an example for application of each one
of them ?

1) Generalization: Cleaning and aggregating the data into one place and then summarizing the main characteristics of the data.
2) Association and correlation analysis: Determining if two pieces of data are strongly correlated. 
3) Classification: Detecting credit card fraud among legitimate transactions.
4) Cluster analysis: Performing unsupervised learning to categorize the data without explicit labels.
5)
